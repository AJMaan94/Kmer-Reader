K-mer Analysis Tool
Version 1.0
Overview
The K-mer Analysis Tool is a Python-based utility for analyzing k-mer frequencies in FastQ sequence files. It generates histogram data that can be used for sequence analysis, quality assessment, and visualization in tools like R or Excel.
Features

Processes FastQ format sequence files
Configurable k-mer length
Generates frequency histograms
Handles large sequence files
Progress tracking during analysis
Tab-separated output format
Memory-efficient processing
N-containing k-mers filtering

Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
No additional dependencies required
Input files in FastQ format
Sufficient memory to handle your sequence data

Installation

Download the script:

bashCopykmer_analyzer.py

Make the script executable (Unix/Linux):

bashCopychmod +x kmer_analyzer.py
Usage
Basic Command
bashCopypython kmer_analyzer.py input.fastq output -k 21
Arguments

input.fastq: Input FastQ file (required)
output: Output filename base, ".txt" will be added automatically (required)
-k, --kmer: K-mer length (default: 21)

Example Commands

Basic usage with default k-mer length:

bashCopypython kmer_analyzer.py sequences.fastq results

Specify custom k-mer length:

bashCopypython kmer_analyzer.py sequences.fastq results -k 15
Input Format
The tool accepts FastQ format files, which contain four lines per sequence:
Copy@Sequence_Identifier
SEQUENCE_LETTERS
+Optional_Description
QUALITY_SCORES
Output Format
The tool generates a tab-separated text file containing:
CopyFreq    Numb
1       45678
2       23456
3       12345
...
Where:

Freq: K-mer frequency
Numb: Number of k-mers occurring at that frequency

Processing Details
K-mer Counting Process

Reads sequences from FastQ file
Generates k-mers of specified length
Counts occurrence of each k-mer
Creates frequency distribution
Writes histogram data to file

Progress Tracking
The tool displays progress messages:
CopyInputting: input.fastq
Outputting to: output.txt
KMer Length: 21

Performance Considerations
Memory Usage

Memory requirements scale with unique k-mer count
For large files, ensure sufficient RAM
N-containing k-mers are filtered out to save memory

Processing Time
Factors affecting processing time:

Input file size
K-mer length
System specifications
Number of unique k-mers

Tips for Optimal Use
Choosing K-mer Length

Shorter k-mers (< 15): Good for finding common motifs
Medium k-mers (15-30): Balanced analysis
Longer k-mers (> 30): Specific sequence identification

Memory Management

Process large files in sections if needed
Monitor system memory during processing
Close other memory-intensive applications

Common Issues and Solutions
Input File Issues

Problem: File not in FastQ format
Solution: Ensure input file follows FastQ specifications
Problem: Memory errors with large files
Solution: Process file in smaller chunks or increase system memory

Output Issues

Problem: Permission denied writing output
Solution: Ensure write permissions in output directory

Limitations

Single-threaded processing
Memory bounded by system RAM
No built-in visualization
Limited to FastQ format input

Future Improvements
Planned features for future versions:

Multi-threading support
Built-in visualization
FASTA format support
Streaming processing for large files
Memory optimization
